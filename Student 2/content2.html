        <h1>Indie Music</h1>
        <p>Indie music is like the rebel of the music world. It's produced and distributed independently, without the help of big record labels. This DIY approach gives indie musicians a chance to be creative and experimental, creating a unique sound that sets them apart from the mainstream. Indie music covers a variety of genres, from rock to electronic to hip-hop.</p>
